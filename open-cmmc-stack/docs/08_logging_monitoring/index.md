# üìä Section 8: Monitoring and Logging

## üéØ Objective

This section guides you through configuring a secure, scalable monitoring and logging stack using **Wazuh**, **Auditd**, and optional remote logging. These components support key CMMC Level 2 controls across **Audit and Accountability (AU)** and **Security Incident Response (IR/SI)** domains.

---

## üß© Why Wazuh?

**Wazuh** is a powerful open-source Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution that offers:

- Host-based intrusion detection (HIDS)
- Centralized log collection and analysis
- File integrity monitoring
- Rootkit and malware detection
- CMMC/NIST 800-171 rule packs

It serves as the primary audit log and incident detection platform in the OpenCMMC stack.

---

## üß™ Deploying Wazuh with Podman

```bash
podman volume create wazuh_data

podman run -d --name wazuh \
  -p 55000:55000 \
  -v wazuh_data:/var/ossec/data \
  docker.io/wazuh/wazuh:4.6.0
```

Optional: expose the dashboard via reverse proxy (NGINX) on HTTPS port `443`.

---

## üìã Configure Auditd (Local Audit Logging)

Install and enable `auditd`:

```bash
sudo apt install auditd audispd-plugins
sudo systemctl enable auditd --now
```

Define critical rules in `/etc/audit/rules.d/cmmc.rules`:

```bash
-w /etc/passwd -p wa -k identity
-w /etc/shadow -p wa -k credentials
-w /var/log/ -p wa -k logfiles
```

Reload rules:

```bash
sudo augenrules --load
```

---

## üîê Secure Logging Best Practices

- Enable **log forwarding** from `auditd` to `rsyslog`, and optionally to Wazuh
- Use TLS for remote log transmission (if using an external SIEM)
- Protect `/var/log` using strict permissions and AIDE
- Retain logs for a minimum of **90 days**, per NIST 800-171 guidance

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Wazuh Agent Integration (Optional for Additional Hosts)

Install Wazuh agents on endpoints and configure secure connection to the Wazuh server using `authd`:

```bash
sudo /var/ossec/bin/agent-auth -m <wazuh_server_ip>
```

Use Wazuh‚Äôs built-in compliance dashboard to validate:

- Policy violations
- Suspicious login activity
- File integrity issues

---

## üõ°Ô∏è CMMC Practices Addressed

| CMMC Practice | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| AU.2.042 | Ensure audit records are reviewed and retained |
| AU.2.043 | Provide audit record protection |
| AU.3.045 | Review and analyze audit logs |
| SI.1.210 | Identify and report anomalous events |
| IR.2.093 | Detect and report incidents automatically |

---

## ‚úÖ Next Step

With monitoring and auditing in place, the next phase is configuring your container environment using hardened Podman runtimes and secure systemd services in **Section 9: Application Hosting**.
