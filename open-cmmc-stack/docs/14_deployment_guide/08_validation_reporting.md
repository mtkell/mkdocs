| Network Controls     | Tailscale overlay ACLs applied         | Tailscale Admin Panel  |
| Email Security      | S/MIME signed + DKIM/SPF passed        | Mailcow, external tools|
| File Integrity      | AIDE/Wazuh scans show no tampering     | Wazuh Dashboard        |
| System Logging      | All services forward logs              | Wazuh, auditd          |

## ðŸ“‚ Collectable Evidence

Youâ€™ll want to store and organize:

- Terraform state files (`terraform.tfstate`)
- Ansible logs or version-controlled playbooks
- Screenshots of admin panels showing:
  - MFA
  - Certs
  - ACLs
- Sample audit log exports (Keycloak, Mailcow, Wazuh)
- Evidence of patching (apt history, unattended-upgrades)
- Step-CA issuance records and cert chains

## ðŸ§ª SSP Traceability

Update your **System Security Plan (SSP)** with:

| Section                | Source Artifacts                    |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| System Description     | Terraform plan, network diagram     |
| Access Controls        | Keycloak config, user group mappings|
| Identification & Authn| Step-CA cert configs, login policies|
| System Integrity       | AIDE config, Wazuh scans            |
| Media Protection       | Nextcloud policy + file share setup|
| Configuration Mgmt     | Ansible repo                        |
| Audit & Accountability | Wazuh reports, auditd logs          |

## ðŸ“¤ Optional Reporting Deliverables

- Daily/weekly PDF audit reports (via Wazuh)
- Manual control assessment checklist (110 controls)
- Executive summary for non-technical stakeholders
