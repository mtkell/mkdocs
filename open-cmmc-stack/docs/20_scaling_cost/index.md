# üìä Section 20: Performance, Scaling & Cost Estimation

## üéØ Objective

This section provides guidance for adapting the OpenCMMC Stack to support various organizational sizes ‚Äî from 1-person SBIR teams to 50-person prime contractors. It includes performance tuning tips, scaling recommendations, and rough monthly cost estimates for DigitalOcean, AWS, or on-prem deployments.

## üß± Baseline Configuration (1‚Äì5 Users)

| Component         | Count | Notes |
|------------------|-------|-------|
| VM Instances      | 1     | 4 vCPU / 8GB RAM minimum |
| Storage Volumes   | 2     | App volume + Backup volume |
| Tailscale Devices | 5     | Laptops, phones, tablets |
| Services          | All   | Same as production stack |

**Monthly Estimate (DigitalOcean):** $35‚Äì55  
- $24 droplet + $10 volume + $5 bandwidth

---

## üìà Mid-Tier Scaling (5‚Äì25 Users)

| Component         | Scaling Tips |
|------------------|--------------|
| Separate DB Host | Move PostgreSQL to a second droplet |
| External S3      | Store backups in Wasabi or Backblaze |
| HA Reverse Proxy | Consider HAProxy or secondary NGINX |
| Logging Volume   | Increase Wazuh retention window to 90d |
| Backup Jobs      | Offload to secondary host or cronbox |

**Monthly Estimate (DO or AWS):** $75‚Äì125  
- 2 droplets + Object storage + Backup egress

---

## üè¢ Large Deployment (25‚Äì50+ Users)

| Component             | Recommendation |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Podman Networking     | Use MACVLAN or custom bridges |
| External Monitoring   | Forward Wazuh to SIEM (Elastic/Splunk) |
| Container Registry    | Self-host Harbor or use GHCR |
| Storage Redundancy    | RAID 1 + offsite Restic |
| MDM Integration       | Link with Intune, Jamf, or FleetDM |
| Email Scaling         | Consider external SMTP relay or Postfix queue tuning |

**Monthly Estimate (Hybrid/on-prem):** $200‚Äì350  
- VM cluster or VPS spread, higher backup costs

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Tuning

- Enable Podman healthchecks and log rotation
- Use Redis caching (for Nextcloud + Keycloak)
- Prune stale containers and old volumes weekly
- Schedule Ansible audits every 7 days
- Keep kernel and container images lean

---

## üìâ Cost Optimization Tips

| Technique | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Use ARM-based VMs | Lower cloud cost (e.g., C6g, Ampere) |
| Use Tailscale exit nodes | Avoid paid VPN/GW services |
| Host Wazuh UI locally | Skip cloud SIEM tiers |
| Use BorgBackup + rclone | Avoid egress-heavy snapshots |

---

## üìú CMMC Practices Supported

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| CP.2.120 | Establish and maintain backups |
| MA.2.111 | Schedule maintenance |
| CM.2.066 | System configuration monitoring |
| AU.2.043 | Capacity planning based on logs |
| RA.2.143 | Identify and manage risks |

## ‚úÖ Next Step

With performance and cost scoped, use Appendix A and B for acronyms and additional resources.
